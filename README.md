# Code refactor project - Horiseon Digital Marketing Agency
## Description

The following project showcases the intergration of HTML and CSS in the make up and design of the landing page for the Horiseon Digital Marketing Agency. Through the understanding of Horiseon and its principles as a business, the following webpage represents a means of connecting clients with their brand and identity, expressing them as a leader within the industry and why they should partner with them for their marketing solutions. 

Developing the key foundational metrics of the project, allowed myself to understand how to plan and design a concise, accessible, and structured files of code to create a unqiue user-story for the client's website. Building this project presented myself with a crucial understanding of how semantics work and how they can improve the overall performance of a coded file. This also provided me with a key learning point of how to use repositories in designing and developing projects, which allow others to integrate and colloborate with your work. 

The following skills developed through the initiative of this project will allow myself to understand information better and also enhance my existing skills with profieincy and effectiveness.
